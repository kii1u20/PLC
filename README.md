# Custom language for modifying Turtle RDF graphs

This repository includes a parser and tokenizer for Turtle, as well as parser and tokenizer for the custom language. It also includes the Happy and Alex files for defining the syntax of the language.

The custom (“STQL”) language is inspired by SQL, and uses similar syntax in order to modify .ttl files. An interpreter is provided, which takes as input the name of the program of type .stql.

report.pdf provides further insight into how the language works. Example applications are provided as well.
